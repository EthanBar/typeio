# typeio
### Why
This project is my first attempt at TDD (test driven development). Additionaly, I wanted to have a multiplayer web
game, but didn't want to work in javascript. So I decided on using typescript as a typed approach to javascript.
# Installation
Setup your node environment
```
npm install
```
And that's it so far.

To run tests:
```
npm test
```
tests will run each time a change is detected
